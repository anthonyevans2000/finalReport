\chapter{Performance and Testing}

\section{Acceleration Constraints}
	%testing acceleration constraints from standstill and while moving
	
	%tests showing how increasing acceleration constraints decrease time for a given curve
\section{S-discretization}
	%tests we did in the oral presentation
	
	%additional test with computation time vs s-points
	
\section{Sample time}

\section{Image Interpolation Performance}
	%few tests showing different images and how well the representation of them is
