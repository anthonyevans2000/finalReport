\subsection{Spline Interpolation}
The spline interpolation algorithm was extremely simple. Complex, accurate and compact methods exist, the implementation of which would vastly improve many aspects of the process. Effects would be seen from the accuracy of the spline interpolation itself through to greater efficiency in calculating the time optimal approximation. However, time constraints did not allow for the implementation of an effective interpolating algorithm. The method used to generate a spline from the final linear approximations of the lines in the image was simply to place control points of a spline at each of the turning points of this linear approximation. The accuracy and efficiency in the number of control points of this method is low, but it was certainly easy to implement and gave a result which was sufficiently accurate for the desired purpose.
