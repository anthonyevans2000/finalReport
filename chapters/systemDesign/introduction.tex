%A challenging problem that we chose to solve for The DoodleBot was path optimisation. Our goal was to solve the optimal control problem which would allow us to achieve the minimum time of operation in following any given path. As this is problem was quite open, we restricted the paths to have the structure of a curve made up of Uniform Rational Basis Splines. 

%We then analysed previous work on optimisation and adapted techniques designed to break the problem into a discrete approximation of the full problem. We went on to use the SeDuMi linear program to achieve an approximation of the optimal Bang-Bang control.

%This chapter will move forward to elucidate a problem statement and discuss the two classes of solution, functional and discrete, before touching on the nature of the SeDuMi linear program which assisted us in achieving optimal velocity profiles from arbitrary URBS curves.


The DoodleBot team chose two performance indicators to design
