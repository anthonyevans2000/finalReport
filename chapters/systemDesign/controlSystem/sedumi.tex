\subsubsection{SeDuMi}

The discretised optimisation problem is formulated into a second order cone solver, SeDuMi so as to be solved with numerical efficiency. For each segment, the bounds on $b(s)$ and $a(s)$ are defined with respect to the acceleration constraints. The calculation of the maximum $\textbf{q}''(s)$ and $\textbf{q}'(s)$ for each discretised path section gives the constraints. The starting and finishing values of $b(s)$ are anchored to zero. Finally, two solution variables are introduced in order to enable the efficiency of a second order cone program. $c(s)$ is introduced as $\sqrt{b(s)}$ and $d(s)$ is introduced as the increment of the cost integral.
The entire solving functionality was automated and wrapped in a function that could solve the optimal trajectory for a curve  given simply an URBS representation and the torque constraints.
