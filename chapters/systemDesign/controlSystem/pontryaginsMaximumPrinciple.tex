\subsection{Pontryagin's Maximum Principle}

We set about attempting to solve the optimal control problem utilising Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. Despite our best efforts, we found the problem to be intractable to solve in the general case.
The major confounding factor we had in finding a continuous and completely optimal solution to our problem lies in the construction of a representation for the interaction of the path constraints on the separate axes.
One can construct a Hamiltonian
