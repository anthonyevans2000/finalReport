	\subsubsection{Programs}
		The programmable logic controller features four programs, shown visually in ~\ref{fig:PLCarchitecture}
	
		\begin{description}
			\item[Governor] \hfill \\
				The Governor is a  state machine that sets the overall state of the DoodleBot controller and controls Communications and motorControl.
			\item[Communications] \hfill \\
				The Communications state machine is in charge of managing the UDP socket interface, all network communications and the populating of the command list.
			\item[motorControl] \hfill \\
				The motorControl state machine handles all stepper motor control.
			\item[checkLimitSwitch] \hfill \\
				The checkLimitSwitch program periodically monitors the limit switch input and triggers an emergency stop if the switches are triggered when not expected at a period of 10ms.
		\end{description}
		
		\subsubsection{Intraprogram Interfaces and Global Data}
		The Governor program interfaces with the Communications and motorControl programs via the two global scoped variables, \textit{motorControl\_mode} and \textit{communications\_mode} which act as intraprogram interfaces. On each state transition, the Governor sets these variables  to certain values, determining what state to move the other programs into. The other programs can then set these variables to different values, informing the Governor on their own state changes and status which the Governor then uses as state transition conditions. Table ~\ref{table:progaminterfaces} shows the possible values of the intraprogram interfaces. 
		
		\begin{table}[htbp!]
			\begin{tabular}{|c|l|l|l|}
				\hline
				Code & motorControl\_mode & communications\_mode & Set By \\ \hline
				00 & Wait & Wait & Governor \\ \hline
				10 & Initialize & Ready & Governor\\ \hline
				11 & Initialization complete & Header received & motorControl/communications \\ \hline
				20 & Operate commands & Buffer command list & Governor \\ \hline
				21 & All buffered commands complete & Buffering complete & motorControl/communications\\ \hline
				22 & N/A & Buffer full & communications\\ \hline
			\end{tabular}
			\caption{Codes for interface between Governor, Communications and motorControl programs}
			\label{table:progaminterfaces}
		\end{table}
	
		In addition to locally scoped variables, there are also several key global scope variables that are used by two or more program that determine the behaviour and input of the system. These are shown in Figure ~\ref{table:globalvariables}

		\end{center}

	\subsection{Governor}
		
		The Governor is a state machine that control the operation of the other programs in the DoodleBot system.
		
		\begin{description}
			\item[POWER\_ON] DoodleBot waits for the user to press one of the Y limit switches to state A to start initialization.
			\item[A\_Init] The DoodleBot checks the boundaries and centres itself on a 'home' position. After this is complete it progresses to state B.
			\item[B\_ready] The DoodleBot starts sending the 'ready' packet periodically to the PC, while waiting for a header to arrive. If a valid header arrives, it transitions to state C. If one of the Y limit switches are pressed, it returns to state A to run through the initialization routine once more.
			\item[C\_buffer] The DoodleBot begins requesting commands from the PC, filling the commandBuffer. When either the commandBuffer is full or all commands have been received, it progresses to state D.
			\item[D\_operating] The DoodleBot begins executing the commands in the commandBuffer. If there are still commands to received, it will continue to buffer when slots are freed up after being executed. After all commands have been processed the system returns to state B, ready for another header.

\subsection{Communications}
	
	The communications program has the role of communicating with the PC to populate the commandBuffer with the output of the PCs optimization stage. Figure ~\ref{fig:communicationsStates} shows the operation of the program.

	\end{figure}

	\subsubsection{Introduction to the AMCI 3401 Stepper Module}
			The main purpose of the motorControl program is to communicate with the two AMCI 3401 Stepper Motor Modules. Their primary role is to send two types of control signals to the stepper motor modules:\\
			\begin{description}
				\item[Step Output] \hfill \\
					A $5V$ square pulse output, with each rising edge signifying a single step of the motor.
				\item[Direction Output] \hfill \\
					A $5V$ boolean output that defines which direction the stepper motors should turn.
			\end{description}
			The modules takes its input by asynchronously monitoring a 16-byte command word on the PLC and mirror it internally. All commands given by the motorControl program involving modifying this command word. \\
			In addition, the module monitors its relative position and operating state by providing a 16-byte status word.\\
			The modules feature a broad range of commands, but the those used by the DoodleBot system are:
			\begin{description}
				\item[Absolute Move] \hfill \\
					Given a position in space (relative to the preset origin position), the AMCI module creates the appropriate velocity profile to get there (within the acceleration/deceleration/top speed parameter limits).
				\item[Relative Move] \hfill \\
					Given a distance to travel (from the current position), the AMCI module creates the appropriate velocity profile to get there (within the acceleration/deceleration/top speed parameter limits).
				\item[Manual Move] \hfill \\
					Manual type moves are actually classified as two separate commands defining the direction of the move  - manual move clockwise, and manual move counterclockwise. These moves accelerate to the programmed speed at the acceleration rate and travel until stopped. While moving in this state, the programmed speed can be changed without having to stop and restart.
				\item[Immediate Stop] \hfill \\
					An immediate stop command stops all current motion.
				\item[Preset Current Position] \hfill \\
					Sets the internal position memory of the module to a position defined in the command word.
			\end{description}
		\subsubsection{Stepper Motor Direction Management}

	\begin{figure}[htbp!]
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/cncMachine/position_direction}
		\caption{The two routines for managing direction and position}
		\label{fig:Direction and Positional Tracking}
	\end{figure}
	
			Empirical observation of the AMCI 3401 modules in operation showed a significant delay (in the order of 2-3 seconds) in between distinct commands. This delay is also present when switching between the Manual Move Clockwise and the Manual Move Counterclockwise states. In comparison, changing the programmed speed while in each state has negligible delay.\\
			
			This behaviour is significant since the optimized velocity profiles require both axes to track the commands within the period of sampling (ideally set to 40-150ms for good results) to follow the required path.\\
			
			To overcome this problem, the DoodleBot system controls the direction output via the PLC embedded DC output pins 0 and 1, and set manually through the motorControl program. To continue using Absolute Moves, this requires extra software functionality to keep track of the current position.
			
			\begin{description}
				\item[Absolute Move, Relative Move] \hfill \\
					Relative Moves are treated by the rest of the code as usual. Absolute Moves must be preceded by a Preset Current Position command with the position set to x\_pos and y\_pos. <blah> function monitors the directional state of the AMCI 3401 modules and mirrors this onto the direction output pins. <gah> function measures the change in position since last scan and adds this to x\_pos and y\_pos.
				\item[Manual Move] \hfill \\
					All manual moves, whether clockwise or anticlockwise, are sent to the AMCI 3401 modules as Manual Move Clockwise at the correct speed. The x\_direction and y\_direction bits need to be explicitly set with each Manual Move command to operate in the required direction. Since the AMCI 3401 module thinks it is always moving clockwise (even when it's not), it's internal position state is no longer correct. Function <gah> measures the change in position since last scan and depending on the direction of movement, adds or subtracts this value to x\_pos and y\_pos.
				\item[Preset Current Position] \hfill \\
					Change the value of x\_pos and y\_pos to mirror the position state in the AMCI 3401 controller.
			\end{description}
			

\subsection{checkLimitSwitch}
	The checkLimitSwitch program is run in a Periodic Task of 10ms and monitors the four limit switches. Upon detecting a rising edge from one of these limit switches, it sets the appropriate boundaryFault value (boundaryFaultX for the X limit switches and boundaryFaultY for the Y limit switches).
	
	If the boundaryFaultDisable is NOT set, it will assume that unintended operation has occurred and an immediate stop command to the stepper motor modules halting all operation. If boundaryFaultDisable IS set then this operation does not happen (used in a situation where motorControl or the Governor are expecting a limit switch input. Eg, boundary checking or waiting for user to manually toggle the switch).
