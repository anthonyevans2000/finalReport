One of the design criteria for the DoodleBot was that the product was easy for a non-technical user to operate. An obvious requirement for this to be the case was the creation of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) which abstracted the URBS curve generation, image filtering and optimisation processing from the user. This would instead give the user an experience which was intuitive and similar to previous experiences with computer programs. To this end, a GUI similar in design to most drawing programs was developed.
Given that the user would be interacting with a simple interface, the pipeline for the generation of printing instructions was automated. This was achieved with a Java program, modules of which formed the GUI, interface with MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered} and the server to the DoodleBot.
