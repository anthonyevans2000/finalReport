\section{Java Program}
The Java code is the backbone that interfaces between the separate modules of the Host system namely; the Graphical User Inferface (GUI), the MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered} optimisation, the profile server and the MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered} image processing. Each module has an associated class and the result of their interactions generates a desired sequence of velocity profiles to be enacted by the CNC machine.
